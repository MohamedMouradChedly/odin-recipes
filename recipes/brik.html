    and a dash of harissa sauce for a spicy kick. It's a popular snack or appetizer in Tunisia, loved for 
    its delicious taste and satisfying crunch.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>

  <li>Finely chop the cilantro and onion. </li>
  <li> Break up some of the preserved tuna in oil, or you can cut it into small pieces. </li>
  <li> Fold the filo pastry sheets into squares. Each sheet should be divided into four equal squares. </li>

     on each side.  </li>
  <li> Remove the brik from the oil and let it drain on a paper towel to remove excess oil.  </li>
